                <p>After trying quite a few Raspberry Pi operating systems and configurations, the new <a className="underline focus:ring-2" href="http://www.RasPlex.com/" rel="nofollow noreferrer">RasPlex</a> is my choice for my home media centre. RasPlex was the best system which supports out of the box: WiFi, Bluetooth, hdmi monitor with analog speakers, and more. The best thing is the entire process took only 15 minutes!</p>
                <p><small>Note: This is an update to the <a className="underline focus:ring-2" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20210318194931/http://jenntesolin.com/blog/2013/09/05/a-look-at-raspmbc-video-streaming/" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Raspmbc set-up article</a>. RasPlex also requires the use of Plex Media Server which is also free, and easily connects to iTunes and various channels.<br /></small></p>
                <h2>Set-up the SD card</h2>
                <p>The first step is to <a className="underline focus:ring-2" href="https://www.rasplex.com/get-started/rasplex-installers.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">download the installer</a> for your Operating System onto your computer. They have installers available for Mac, Linux, and Windows, please be sure to read the notes on how to mount the installer.</p>
                <p>Now, you select the version of RasPlex you want, and then select your SD card drive (check disk utility for the name if your not sure). Finally, press &quot;update links&quot;, and when that is down &quot;click download&quot;.Â It will ask you the location of the download, then when will display the download progress in the terminal. Once your all set-up, then press &quot;Write SD card&quot;.</p>

                <h2>Set-Up your Raspberry Pi</h2>
                <p>Make sure all your devises (even Bluetooth and Wi-Fi) are connected, then boot your machine. Let it run the initial set-up, and reboot itself.</p>
                <p>Once it reboots, follow the on screen instructions for set-up (note that only your keyboard will work so far). Some of the set-up options include: Blue-tooth, WI-Fi, your Plex Media Server.</p>
                <p>When you see the menu, press the left keyboard arrow to get to your settings, this is where you can set-up your audio settings, ssh access, and more. At set-up it will choose HDMI audio, just select analog to use stereo speakers.</p>
