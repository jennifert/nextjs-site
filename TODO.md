# ✅ TODO List for jenntesolin.com Project

## 🔝 Current Top Priorities

1. 🖼️ **Fix and finalize all blog and gallery images**
   - ✅ Organize into correct `/public/blog/...` folders
   - ✅ Clean filename hashes
   - ✅ Compare to `image-references.md`
   - ⏳ Restore remaining missing files (see image references) may already be in folder, may need to recreate unfortunately.
   - ⏳ Update any broken `<Image />` paths in blog posts easiest to just see public/blogs, its using same folder as page file name.
        - [ ] 🚨 Restore and optimize all images based on [`image-references.md`](./image-references.md)
        - Update broken `src` paths as needed
        - Remove loader code (e.g., blurDataURL or dynamic placeholders)
        - Example:
            ```js
            <Image
            src="/images/blog/2012-11-08-japan-trip-2011/photo1.jpg"
            alt="Japan trip street scene"
            width={800}
            height={600}
            />
            ```
2. 🚀 **Deploy to DigitalOcean**
    - Target: [jenntesolin.com](http://jenntesolin.com)
   - Will update domain DNS after confirming image fixes + production build
   - ⏳ Finalize working `deploy.yaml`
        - [ ] 🚨 Add `.do/app.yaml` for **DigitalOcean App Platform** deployment
   - ⏳ Test live site behavior post-deploy
   - ⏳ Confirm environment variables + build script
   - ⏳ Set up GitHub Actions or push pipeline

> Once these two are complete, resume other lower-priority tasks (broken links, feature enhancements, accessibility).
